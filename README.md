# pygraphs

Framework for clustering graphs using various distances/proximity measures.

List of distances/proximity measures:
* Shortest Path and Commute Time (and linear combination)
* plain Walk (Von Neumann diffusion kernel)
* Forest (Regularized Laplacian kernel)
* Communicability (Exponential diffusion kernel)
* Heat kernel (Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel)
* logarithmic versions of Walk, Forest, Communicability, Heat
* Sigmoid Commute Time
* Sigmoid Corrected Commute Time
* Randomized Shortest Path
* Free Energy
* Normalized Heat
* Regularized Laplacian
* Personalized PageRank
* Modified Personalized PageRank
* Heat Personalized PageRank

List of clustering algoritms:
* Kernel k-means
* Spectral clustering
* Ward

List of graph generators:
* Stochastic Block Model

List of graph samples:
* Football
* Polbooks
* Polblogs
* Zachary
* Newsgroup
